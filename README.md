# CalcYouLater üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: aimless.exe


### Team Members
- Member 1: Meenakshi Kaimal - MEC
- Member 2: Georgia Rose George- MEC

### Project Description
Built as part of TinkerHub‚Äôs ‚ÄúUseless Projects‚Äù challenge, CalcYouLater takes a simple calculator and turns it into a chaotic, meme-fueled, mood-reactive experience. The goal? To push creativity, experiment with interactive front-end elements, and make something delightfully impractical yet technically sound.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The ridiculous problem of having a fully working computer the solves the need for knowing our moods based on our cursor speeds.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By building a ‚Äúuseless‚Äù yet technically challenging project as part of TinkerHub‚Äôs Useless Projects challenge, we combined cursor speed tracking, mood mapping, and playful UI feedback into a functional calculator. Now, alongside crunching numbers, the app reads your cursor behavior and serves you mood-based toast notifications‚Ä¶ often accompanied by memes, glitch effects, and chaos mode for maximum overkill.
