# CalcYouLater 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: aimless.exe 


### Team Members
- Member 1: Meenakshi Kaimal - MEC
- Member 2: Georgia Rose George- MEC

### Project Description
Built as part of TinkerHub’s “Useless Projects” challenge, CalcYouLater takes a simple calculator and turns it into a chaotic, meme-fueled, mood-reactive experience. The goal? To push creativity, experiment with interactive front-end elements, and make something delightfully impractical yet technically sound.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The ridiculous problem of having a fully working computer the solves the need for knowing our moods based on our cursor speeds.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By building a “useless” yet technically challenging project as part of TinkerHub’s Useless Projects challenge, we combined cursor speed tracking, mood mapping, and playful UI feedback into a functional calculator. Now, alongside crunching numbers, the app reads your cursor behavior and serves you mood-based toast notifications… often accompanied by memes, glitch effects, and chaos mode for maximum overkill.

This video showcases CalcYouLater, a front-end web application built for TinkerHub’s Useless Projects challenge.
It’s a fully functional calculator wrapped in a chaotic, meme-infused, mood-reactive interface.

Core Highlights in the Demo
Calculation Engine:
Pure JavaScript implementation for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Event delegation for button clicks and keyboard inputs.
Mood Detection System:
Tracks real-time mouse cursor velocity using mousemove events.
Maps cursor speed ranges to predefined moods.
Displays context-specific toast notifications in a fixed-position stack.
Meme & Chaos Mode:
Random meme images inserted into the DOM with CSS-driven fall animations.
Screen shake effect triggered via temporary CSS keyframe class injection.

UI / UX Features:
Theme Switching: CSS variables power instant swaps between Neon, Pastel, and Professional modes.
Glassmorphism Design: Layered translucent backgrounds with backdrop-filter blur.

Custom Animations:
Ripple effect on button click using dynamically created elements.
Glitch effect on display output via clip-path and CSS keyframes.
Glowing animated borders in chaos mode using conic gradients.

Performance Considerations:
All animations hardware-accelerated via transform and opacity.
Event listeners debounced where necessary to prevent performance bottlenecks.
